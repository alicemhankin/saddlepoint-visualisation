Here are all the files related to my master's dissertation - "visualising the saddlepoint approximation". I was awarded an A+ for this project :)

- **report.pdf** - my final complete dissertation. View as a pdf [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/alicemhankin/saddlepoint-visualisation/d2d1748972e839cdc024930351bc1948275e0307/report.pdf). This contains all sorts of interesting content about exponential tilting, Poisson processes, effective data visualisation, and R Shiny as well as the saddlepoint approximation.

- **slideshow.pdf** - a slideshow to accomany a 15-minute talk overviewing the whole project

- **known.R** - R code for an application to visualise the saddlepoint approximation to known distribution. This application is hosted at https://saddlepoint.shinyapps.io/visualise. Check it out!

    - **user-guide.html** - a user guide for the application. Access it [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/alicemhankin/saddlepoint-visualisation/f78c06a646d96ff91b52ce43bff484400f32ed8b/user-guide.html).
    
    - **user-guide-video.mp4** - a video explaining what the application is demonstrating. The video is also included within the user guide.

- **two.R** - application for visualising saddlepoint approximations to the sum of two known distributions. This is hosted at https://saddlepoint.shinyapps.io/sum-of-two.

- **bivariate.R** - application for visualising saddlepoint approximations to bivariate distributions.
